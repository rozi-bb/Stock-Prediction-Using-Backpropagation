Stocks are certificates that show proof of ownership of a company, and shareholders have the right to claim the profits and assets of the company. Changes in stock prices can change in seconds, so it is considered very fast. Stock prices often fluctuate, so to convince investors to want to invest, it is necessary to make accurate stock price predictions. In this study, the Backpropagation neural network algorithm was implemented to predict the stock price of PT Smartfren Telecom Tbk using historical stock data, inflation, interest rates, and the rupiah exchange rate from 2012 to 2021. From the test results using the Backpropagation artificial neural network algorithm, the RMSE value was 0.019027 for the training process and RMSE 0.22974 for the testing process.
